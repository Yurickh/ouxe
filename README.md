# Ouxe

Basic configuration tool for my common setup

It should be able to handle:

- yarn
- prettier
- jest
- eslint
- basic babel

Running linters and prettier with husky with precommit hooks.

## Running locally

Run an instance of `yarn start` so microbundle watches the src folder while building.

From there, you run `yarn ouxe` to execute the command.
